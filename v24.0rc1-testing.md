### Observing the new headers pre-synchronization phase during IBD

**Chain**: Mainnet

**Logs for headers pre-sync**

**Watching the getpeerinfo output**

<insert screenshot>

:heavy_check_mark: As expected, the presynced_headers field is set for the peer currently involved in the presync/sync phase (instead of -1)

Observe Further: The peer I was syncing with did not disconnect, and no new blocks came in during headers pre-sync/sync. As a result, I did not observe any of the less common scenarios described in the guide.
